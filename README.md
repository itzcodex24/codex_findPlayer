<h1 align="center">Codex Police Find Player [vRP] </h1>

* Hello There üëã. This is a FiveM resource where players can find information about other players using a licence plate and track them in real time! ‚¨áÔ∏è

* Once a player has inputed ‚å®Ô∏è the licence plate of a vehicle, and clicked on get info, the user is then prompted with information about the player! ‚¨áÔ∏è
