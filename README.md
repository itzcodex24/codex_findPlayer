<h1 align="center">Codex Police Find Player [vRP] </h1>

* Hello There üëã. This is a FiveM resource where players can find information about other players using a licence plate and track them in real time! ‚¨áÔ∏è

* Once a player has inputed ‚å®Ô∏è the licence plate of a vehicle, and clicked on get info, the user is then prompted with information about the player! ‚¨áÔ∏è

```
Config = {
    menuCoords = {
        {-455.93838500976,-2810.7602539062,7.2959337234498} -- Menu spawn coords!
    },
    menuMarker = 6,-- Marker to be shown at menu spawn point - https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/markers/
    menuOpenButton = 38, -- Button to open menu (38 = "E") - https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/controls/
    policeGroup = "police.member", -- Permission needed in vrp/cfg/groups.lua to access the menu
    openMenuText = "Press E to open the menu!", -- Message displayed to player to open the menu
    errorTextDetails = "No details about the user have been entered!", -- Error for not inputing details about the player
    trackSuccessMessage = "The person has been tracked successfully!", -- Message for successful tracking!
    cantTrackYourself = "You cannot track yourself on the map!", -- Error for not traking yourself!
    noAccessToCommand = "You do not have access to this command!", -- Error for no access to menu!
    licenceNotFound = "This licence plate was not found in our database!", -- Error for when a vehicles licence is not found in DB

    trackOffMessage = "The person has been unmarked from the map!", -- Message for unmarking a player off the map!
}

-- Remember! You can use '~p~' etc. to style the openMenuText !
